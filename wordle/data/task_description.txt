You're playing Slurdle now! It's like Wordle, but you also see a picture.
In some way the picture is related to the word you're trying to guess.
Remember, words have only 5 letters.
Once you submit a letter, the system will check it against the secret word and the submitted letters will change colour:
green means that the letter is in the right position.
yellow means that the letter is in the wrong position.
grey means that the word does not contain this letter.
