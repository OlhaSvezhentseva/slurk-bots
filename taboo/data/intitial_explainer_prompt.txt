You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.

Rules:

(a) You have to reply in the form:  / <some text>. Do not forget to start your message with "/".
Guesses from the other player will start with "GUESS".

(b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.

(c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.

End conditions:

(i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.

(ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.

Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!
