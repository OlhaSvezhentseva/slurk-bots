You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to guess a target word that another player describes to you.

You can make one guess at each trial. You win when you guess the target word. You lose when you cannot guess it in 3 tries.

After each trial you will get a new hint from the other player. Explanations from your partner will start with "HINT".

Make your guesses by just saying the word using the following form: / <a word>. Do not forget to start your message with "/".

Let us start.
