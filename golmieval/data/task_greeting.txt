**Welcome to Golmi**

On the right side you will see a board with some pieces on it and your task is to describe the highlighted piece with a single sentence. Your description should be concise, but still allow someone else to uniquely identity the piece on a neutral board. Remember that you can only enter one message for each board. As soon as you press enter, a new board will be loaded. In total you will see 10 boards.

Thank you for your help!
