Welcome to the Math-Bot! You have been matched to another user.

With the command /question [your math expression here] you can send a math question to the room.

The bot will forward it to all the users and once a question is in the room you and other users can answer it with the command /answer [your answer here].

Once an answer will be accepted, the Bot will check if it is correct.

Try some of these questions or create your own!
